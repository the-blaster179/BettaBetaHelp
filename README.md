# BettaBetaHelp

BettaBetaHelp is a plugin designed to assist players on the server BettaBeta by using commands such as /help and /fullhelp to list commands available.

### Why not use Essentials?

In Beta 1.7.3 CraftBukkit, Essentials wasn't working very well and I figured that I'd code my own plugin.

### Features

 * `/help` - Lists the most common and important commands, designed for new users
 * `/fullhelp <page>` Lists all commands available to the user and is seperated into pages.
  * `<page>` is an integer. Characters other than 0-9 won't be accepted

### Problems/Known caveats

Currently, I'm getting a compiler error and I'm unsure on how to go about it, so I've put my project here so that people who do know how to go about it can help me out on finding a solution.

Once a solution is found, I'll just keep this here and keep updating it so that new coders can learn off my (shotty) code.
